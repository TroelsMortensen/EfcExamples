# EfcExamples

This project is an example of how to configure various relationships between entities. The database setup, i.e. DbContext, and Entities are found in **Goodreads.Data** project.

The **Goodreads.DataGeneration** project is used to generate the database. Some of the data is an extract of my own from GoodReads.com. Some of the data is just randomly generated.

The **Goodreads.ExampleUsage** project is mainly just junk.

Exercises can be found in **Goodreads.Exercises**.

Below is a entity class diagram:
